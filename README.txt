How to run the website:
Firstly, all the folders and files must be stored in a root folder "www", this is for support to host the local server on the browser. The homepage is named "inder.php" this is where the website will start off, use the register button to go to the vendor or customer, or shipper registration page, after successfully registering, just simply use the log-in button to access the login page. While the log-in state is finished the user will be redirected immediately to my account page where the basic information is stored, and based on the role of each account, the user can view the pages which were created for each role (i.e customer page, vendor page, shipper page). When all the tasks are completed by the user, one can choose to continue new work or they can log out by pressing the log out button.
