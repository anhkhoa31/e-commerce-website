                <h2>B. Types of notices not accepted</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Distribution Agreements
                        <p>We respect the rights of brand owners, manufacturers, trading companies and / or distributors to enter into agreements in relation to how their products should be distributed (such as exclusive distribution agreements). However, violations of such agreements do not constitute IPR infringement. As the enforcement of agreements relating to the distribution of products is a matter between the parties to such agreements, we do not assist with this type of enforcement activity. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Compatibility
                        <p>Lazada does not enforce notices of infringement seeking to remove or alter true statements indicating compatibility with trademarked products. If a product detail page clearly and truthfully represents that the product being sold on that page is compatible with a trademarked product, Lazada will not process notices directed against the use of the trademarked sign.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Jurisdiction
                        <p>If you are filing a notice to Lazada for the infringement of a registered trademark, patent or design, your registered trademark, patent or design must be registered in the country where you are filing the notice of infringement. Lazada does not take action in respect of IPR infringement notices concerning registered trademarks, designs, or patents from countries other than the country for which the takedown is requested. For example, if you are the proprietor of a trademark registered only in Thailand and you file a notice through the IPP Platform to remove a listing on the Platform in Singapore, your notice will be unsuccessful.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Parallel Imports
                        <p>Except where expressly prohibited pursuant to the laws of the country where the IPR infringement notice is filed, Lazada will not process notices directed against parallel import or grey market products in the countries where the Platform is located.</p>
